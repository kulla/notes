* [Daniel R. Collins](http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/users/5563/daniel-r-collins) berichtet in [diesem Kommentar](http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/11306/teaching-a-pre-calculus-course-using-basic-mathematics-by-serge-lang#comment26203_11306): „I'll say that I used one of [Serge Lang's] books in graduate school and it was pretty much the worst thing that ever happened to me; it literally set back my career, possibly permanently. In private discussion with a colleague of Lang's, I was told "Oh yes, we all knew he wrote terrible books..."“
